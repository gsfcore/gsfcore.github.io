----------------------------------------------------------------------
What “impacts” are we looking at? (Achieve a pre-singularity cognitized infrastructure)
1. Digitalization (address the digital divide - it still exists, but this is about bringing in digital tools and methods into the spectrum of human economic activities) 
2. Cognitization (address the cognitive divide)
   1. Ref. https://www.dqindia.com/programming-for-all/ (2008 vintage)
3. Democratization (equal access and inclusive framework for digital cognitization)
   1. Human Language neutrality (all technologies available in all human languages)
   2. Collaborative models of technology access
   3. Technology for “basic-needs” should be built for and made available to all
      1. Health
      2. Education
      3. Livelihood
      4. Social justice
      5. Food and agriculture
      6. Habitat - environment and natural resources
      7. Energy and space
4. Securitization (this is a corollary to digitalization - top priority in current situation)
5. Technological resilience (#AtmanirbharBharat for #VasudhaivaKutumbakam)
   1. Public domain hyperscale / exascale compute infrastructure for India
   2. Storage and communication needs
